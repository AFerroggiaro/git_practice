        <h3>What We Do - Patient Tools</h3>
          <p>Zhealus has developed two free tools to help you during an acute illness or injury.  These tools give you or your family member more control over the doctor visit to an urgent care or emergency department and your recovery.</p>
            <h3>Acute Care Visit Pilot</h3>
              <p>Use this tool when you are planning to visit an emergency department or urgent care with a new illness or injury like a new cough or abdominal pain.  This pilot format is built on how a doctor is trained to ask and think about your illness or injury.  The sections will "pilot" or guide you during your doctorâ€™s evaluation.  This will save you and your doctor time, insure that your doctor has fully addressed your issues and that your questions are answered. <a href="pilotZ.html"> Register for the Pilot Tool</a></p>
            <h3>Tracking Treatment Effectiveness "Z" Assessment</h3>
              <p> Use this tool after you see a doctor for an acute condition (like above). Several assessments are sent through text messaging requesting you report on your recovery. Zhealus will track your recovery and provide feedback to your doctor.  <a href="tteZ.html">Register for the Tracking Treatment Tool</a>.</p>
