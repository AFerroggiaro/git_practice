        <h3>Acute Care Visit Pilot</h3>
              <p>Use this tool when you are planning to visit a doctor or clinic for an acute health condition like a new cough or abdominal pain.  This pilot tool will protect you and make your visit more successful. The format is built on how a doctor is trained to ask and think about your illness or injury.  The sections will "pilot" or guide you during your doctorâ€™s evaluation.  This will save you and your doctor time and also insure that your doctor has fully addressed your issues, your questions are answered, and that you receive the highest quality of care.</p>
